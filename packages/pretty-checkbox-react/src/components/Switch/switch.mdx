# Switch

## Intro
Switches are an interested pattern that was popularized by mobile operating systems like iOS and Android. Switches are typically associated with simple
boolean values (e.g. yes/no) and they offer a way to break out of the banalities of using checkboxes. PCR allows you to use Switch either as
a checkbox or as a radio; however, by default Switch is configured to act as a **checkbox**.

While using this can be exciting, there are a few things that need to considered:

* When used as a Checkbox
    * No `mixed` or `indeterminate` state
    * Not valid to represent a tree-like structure of items
* When used as a Radio/Radio Group
    * Works as a series of radio options, but will not scale to more than a few options
    * Can lead to a confusing experience

Finally, the examples below serve as a means to _highlight features_ of the Switch component. They do not serve as UX guidelines.

### Switch Differences
Switch has a few key differences from Checkbox and Radio worth noting:

* No `icon` prop
* `fill` modes are different (see example)
* `type` prop exposed, can be `checkbox` or `radio`

## Basic Switch with Hooks

<Playground>
    {() => {
        // because switch is a reserved word
        const switchHook = useSwitchState();

        return (
            <Switch {...switchHook}>
                Basic Switch with Hooks
            </Switch>
        );
    }}
</Playground>

## Basic Switch without Hooks
Similar to Radio and Checkbox, Switch can be used without hooks if you're still in the process of migrating to hooks.

## Switch as a Radio
Switch can be used as a checkbox or a radio. Just specify the `type` prop and everything it taken care of for you.

<Playground>
    {() => {
        // because switch is a reserved word
        const switchHook = useSwitchState();

        return (
            <Switch type="radio" {...switchHook}>
                Basic Switch as a Radio
            </Switch>
        );
    }}
</Playground>

## Fill Modes
Switch has different fill modes compared to Radio and Checkbox. The three choices are:

* `outline` (default)
* `fill`
* `slim`

<Playground>
    {() => {
        // because switch is a reserved word
        const switchHook = useSwitchState();

        return (
            <>
                <Switch type="radio" value="outline" {...switchHook}>
                    Outline
                </Switch>
                <Switch type="radio" fill="fill" value="fill" {...switchHook}>
                    Fill
                </Switch>
                <Switch type="radio" fill="slim" value="slim" {...switchHook}>
                    Slim
                </Switch>
            </>
        );
    }}
</Playground>


## Composing Switches using Hooks
One of the patterns mentioned above is using the Switch component in a settings page. Since we can use the switch as a checkbox _or_ radio
we can compose one or more hooks to represent the state of the entire page. Let's see an example:

<Playground>
    {() => {
        const switchState = useSwitchState(["enableEmail", "enablePush"]);

        return (
            <table
                style={{
                    borderCollapse: 'collapse',
                    width: '50%'
                }}>
                <tbody>
                    <tr style={{ borderBottom: '1px solid #ccc' }}>
                        <td>Enable email notifications</td>
                        <td>
                            <Switch value="enableEmail" {...switchState} />
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr style={{ borderBottom: '1px solid #ccc' }}>
                        <td>Enable push notifications</td>
                        <td>
                            <Switch value="enablePush"{...switchState} />
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr style={{ borderBottom: '1px solid #ccc' }}>
                        <td>Allow app to use location</td>
                        <td>
                            <Switch value="allowLoc" {...switchState} />
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Display avatar</td>
                        <td>
                            <Switch value="useAvatar" {...switchState} />
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        );
    }}
</Playground>
