Pretty Checkbox React (PCR) is a tiny implementation of a `radio`, `checkbox`, and mobile-like switch control _powered by_ [Pretty Checkbox](https://lokesh-coder.github.io/pretty-checkbox/). That being said, PCR is more than a component library, there are APIs to help with various integrations and tasks including:

-   Hooks to help manage state
-   Easy checkbox indeterminate support
-   Works with managed-state form solutions (e.g. `formik`)
-   Works with uncontrolled form solutions (e.g. `react-hook-form`)
-   and more...

## Components

At the core of PCR lies three components:

-   `Checkbox`
-   `Radio`
-   `Switch`

By themselves, the components render regular old HTML.

```jsx live
function App() {
    return (
        <>
            <Checkbox>Click me!</Checkbox>
            <Radio>Select me!</Radio>
            <Switch>Click me!</Switch>
        </>
    );
}
```

## Refs &amp; Uncontrolled Usage

When using as a standalone component or in a form, all PCR components support [uncontrolled usage](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html).

:::info
When we pass a `ref` it will be attached to the underlying HTML `input` element.

Below is a contrived example where we check the checkbox automatically after three seconds.

```jsx live
function App() {
    const ref = React.useRef(null);

    React.useEffect(() => {
        const id = setTimeout(() => {
            if (ref.current) {
                ref.current.checked = true;
            }
        }, 3000);

        return () => {
            clearTimeout(id);
        };
    }, []);

    return <Checkbox ref={ref}>I will get checked in 3 seconds</Checkbox>;
}
```

## Controlled Usage

Controlled components are driven by changes in state. To make this a whole lot easier, PCR has hooks for that!

-   `useCheckboxState`
-   `useRadioState`
-   `useSwitchState`

Using the hooks is like eating cake :cake:

```jsx live
function App() {
    const checkbox = useCheckboxState();

    return (
        <>
            <Checkbox {...checkbox}>Controlled Mode</Checkbox>
            <p>Checked {checkbox.state + ''}</p>
        </>
    );
}
```

## Prop Forwarding

Libraries should be flexible in nature. It brings me a whole lot of joy to see that my random HTML props are passes to the component I expect. PCR passes _all_ HTML props to the underlying `input` element to allow for seamless integration with forms, testing libraries/frameworks, etc.

Heres an example of us passing a `data-testid` that can be used by `@testing-library/react`:

```jsx
<Checkbox data-testid="my-checkbox">Do you agree to the terms and conditions?</Checkbox>
```

Need to make the checkbox `required` using regular old HTML? No biggie üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

```jsx live
function App() {
    return (
        <form className="form">
            <div className="form__group">
                <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>{' '}
                <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required />
            </div>
            <div className="form__group">
                <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>{' '}
                <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />
            </div>
            <div className="form__group">
                <Checkbox required>I have read the terms &amp; conditions</Checkbox>
            </div>
            <div className="form__group">
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </div>
        </form>
    );
}
```

## Accessibility

PCR leverages native HTML `input` elements to be accessible, but regular old HTML doesn't give us everything for free. A few things are done to support a11y out of the box:

-   Linking `label` and `input` fields using generated UUIDs
-   Using the correct ARIA `role` for `Switch`
-   Using the necessary `aria-*` attributes (e.g. indeterminate checkbox setting `aria-checked="mixed"`)

The main goal of PCR is to provide the essentials without restricting you from adding additional props.
