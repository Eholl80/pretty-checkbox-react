At the heart and soul of every application is at least one checkbox. It might be a terms and conditions agreement,
"Do not sell" CCPA notice, or something else; whatever it is, `pretty-checkbox-react` (PCR) has your back.

## Shapes, Variants, & States

There's no "one size fits all" for input controls like Checkbox.
Thankfully, PCR allows you to represent Checkbox in various ways via the `shape` and `variant` prop
for pre-bundled fun. See the [`shapes`](getting-started/shapes-size) docs for more details.

```jsx live
<>
    <Checkbox>Regular</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox shape="curve" variant="thick">Thick Curve</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox shape="round" variant="fill">Fill Round</Checkbox>
</>
```

### Disabled &amp; Locked

Of course `disabled` is supported, but there's also a secondary state called `locked`.
See the [states](getting-started/states) docs for more details.

```jsx live
<>
    <Checkbox>Regular</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox disabled>Disabled</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox locked>Locked</Checkbox>
</>
```

### Scalability

Out of the box, PCR offers a `bigger` prop to make all input controls just a tad bit larger.
For more fine-grained control check out the [size docs](getting-started/shapes-size#size).

```jsx live
<>
    <Checkbox>Regular</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox bigger>Bigger</Checkbox>
</>
```

## Controlled

## Indeterminate

Building a wickedly awesome control that needs `indeterminate`, or tri-state support?
PCR has you covered for controlled and uncontrolled components.
