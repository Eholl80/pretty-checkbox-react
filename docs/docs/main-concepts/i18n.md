PCR doesn't contain any locale-specific strings that are rendered in the browser. Since you, the super awesome user of PCR, provides all the content, it seamlessly integrates into your i18n/l10n/g11n solution :smile:

## RTL Usage

PCR is a stylish wrapper around standard HTML elements which means LTR support requires **zero configuration**.

```jsx live
<Checkbox dir="rtl">Hello</Checkbox>
```
